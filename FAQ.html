The artist will be paid after the purchaser has received the artwork in good order and is satisfied with the goods. After receipt of the artwork the purchaser has three days (72 hours) to notify Online Gallery if there are any defects or other problems, via support@onlinegallery.art. During these three days OnlineGallery keeps the client’s money secure, after which the amount will automatically be processed and released for payment to the artist. The artist will be paid within 30 days the artwork has been received by the purchaser. In case of serious default by the artist Online Gallery will reimburse the cost of the artwork to the buyer. If necessary Online Gallery can mediate.

					Make sure the description is correct and complete. Include all available information: on history and provenance, the artist, art movement. If there is damage, mention this. 

					Decide on a realistic opening price and use good images of the artwork. Only use the best photos. Mention the auction on your social media to generate interest.

					Use the gallery price as a starting point. A realistic opening bid is approximately 20 per cent of the gallery price. If there is no such reference, consider a valuation of the artwork.

					A known ‘technique’ at auction sales is to start with a very low auction price to encourage bidding. Do bear in mind this carries a risk: if the winning bid disappoints, the hammer price is binding.

Avoid shadows, do not use a flash, use day light. Make sure the image is level, use a tripod. To straighten the image afterwards, use the photo editing program on your laptop or mobile phone.
